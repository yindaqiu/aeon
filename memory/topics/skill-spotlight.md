# Skill Spotlight — Rotation State

Queue + history for `skills/skill-spotlight/`. The picker reads top-down, skips anything covered in the last 30 days or in the blocklist.

Edit freely — this file is operator-owned config, not auto-managed except for `## Covered (last 30 days)`, which the skill appends to and prunes each run.

## Queue

Ordered list of skills to feature next. The picker takes the first one not in `Covered (last 30 days)` and not in `Blocklist`. Append new entries at the bottom; the head moves down naturally as each is covered.

The starter pack below targets *observable* skills with clear single-purpose output — the format works best when the "Result ⤵️" screenshot is something a reader can grok in one glance. Edit to taste.

## Covered (last 30 days)

The skill appends here after each successful run. Entries older than 30 days are pruned automatically.

## Blocklist

Never feature these — they are meta/internal/repair skills that don't read as user-facing features. Add or remove entries to taste.

## Notes

- The starter queue is intentionally short (~12 skills). Extend it as the framework grows or as you discover skills that screenshot well.
- If the format ever drifts (a new post doesn't visually match the prior days), check the SKILL.md anti-patterns section — the cadence is the brand.

description: Build a feature for every watched repo in one run — iterates the full repo list, picks one feature per repo from yesterday's repo-actions ideas first
var: ""
tags: [dev, build]

> **${var}** — Optional. If set, build this specific feature for the FIRST watched repo only. If empty, iterate every watched repo and pick per-repo.

This skill is the **multi-repo** sibling of `external-feature`:

| | `feature` (this skill) | `external-feature` |
|---|---|---|
| Per run | Iterates **every** watched repo, ships one PR per repo | **Single** repo per run |
| Repo source | `memory/watched-repos.md` | `memory/watched-repos.md` (or `${var}` override) |
| Use it for | Weekly broad sweep — keep every repo moving | Targeted enhancement on one repo |
| Notification | One per successfully-built feature (per repo) | One per run |

Today is ${today}. Read `memory/MEMORY.md` and the last 7 days of `memory/logs/` before starting.

## Voice

If `soul/SOUL.md` and `soul/STYLE.md` are populated, read both and match the operator's voice in every per-repo notification. If they are empty templates or absent, use a clear, direct, neutral tone — short sentences, no corporate launch-language.

## Config

This skill reads the candidate repo list from `memory/watched-repos.md`. If the file is missing or empty, log `FEATURE_NO_CONFIG` and exit cleanly (no notification — empty config is not an error).

Format: one `owner/repo` per line. Markdown bullets like `- owner/repo` are fine; comment lines starting with `#` are ignored.

## Steps

### 1. Load the target list

Parse `memory/watched-repos.md` into a list of `owner/repo` entries.

If `${var}` is set, restrict the list to **the first repo only** and use `${var}` as the feature spec for it.

### 2. For each repo in the list, run steps 3–10 independently

A failure on one repo must NOT stop the others — catch the failure, log it, continue. Use a fresh working directory per repo (e.g. `/tmp/feature-build-${repo-name}`).

### 3. Pick what to build for this repo

In this priority order:

a. **If `${var}` is set AND this is the first repo**, build that.
b. **Check yesterday's `repo-actions` output** in `articles/repo-actions-*.md` (most recent file) for ideas scoped to THIS repo. Pick the highest-impact idea that's autonomously implementable.
c. **Check open GitHub issues labelled `ai-build`** on this repo:
   ```bash
   gh issue list -R owner/repo --label ai-build --state open
   ```
d. **Check `memory/MEMORY.md`** for planned features or next priorities tied to this repo.
e. **If none of the above yields anything for this repo**, log `FEATURE_SKIP: <repo> — no suitable feature found` and **skip to the next repo. Do NOT send a notification for skipped repos.**

### 4. Clone the repo

Into a per-repo temp directory:

```bash
gh repo clone owner/repo /tmp/feature-build-${repo-name}
cd /tmp/feature-build-${repo-name}
```

### 5. Read the codebase

Understand the project structure, README, package.json/config files, recent commits, and the area you'll modify:

```bash
git log --oneline -20
```

Read the area you'll modify in full before changing anything.

### 6. Implement the feature

Write clean, complete code. No TODOs or placeholders. Match the existing code style exactly — indentation, naming, patterns. Don't introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary. Don't refactor unrelated code — stay focused on one improvement.

### 7. Branch and push

```bash
git checkout -b feat/<short-feature-name>
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: <description of what was built>"
git push -u origin feat/<short-feature-name>
```

### 8. Open a PR

```bash
gh pr create -R owner/repo \
  --title "feat: <short description>" \
  --body "## What
<Description of the feature>

## Why
<What triggered this — repo-actions idea, issue, or gap identified>

## Changes
- file1: what changed
- file2: what changed

---
*Built autonomously by Aeon*"
```

### 9. Update memory

Log what was built (per repo) to `memory/logs/${today}.md`. Include the repo name in every log line so per-repo history stays distinct:

```markdown
## Feature — owner/repo
- **Built:** <feature name>
- **Why:** <trigger>
- **PR:** <url>
- **Files:** <list>
- FEATURE_OK
```

### 10. Notify — one per successfully built feature

For each repo with a shipped PR, send a separate `./notify` so the operator gets a detailed per-repo message. The notification should be rich enough that a reader understands exactly what was built, why it matters, and how it works WITHOUT clicking the PR link.

**Do NOT compress into 1–2 lines. Every section below is REQUIRED.**

```
*Feature Built — ${today} — owner/repo*

<Feature name>
<2–3 sentence description of what the feature does in plain language. Explain it like you're telling a non-technical reader in the community what just got added to the project.>

Why this matters:
<2–3 sentences on why this is relevant to the project RIGHT NOW. What problem did users/developers have before? What triggered this — a repo-actions idea, a GitHub issue, a gap in the codebase? How does it move the project forward?>

What was built:
- <file/component>: <what was added/modified — be specific about the functionality, not just "added endpoint">
- <file/component>: <same level of detail>
- <file/component (if applicable)>: ...

How it works:
<3–4 sentences on the technical implementation. Approach taken and why. Libraries/APIs used. How it integrates with existing code. Any interesting design decisions.>

What's next:
<1–2 sentences on follow-up work or how this connects to the broader roadmap.>

PR: <url>
```

BAD (too short — do NOT do this):
> "Feature Built: Data Export. Users can download results as JSON/CSV. PR: url"

GOOD level of detail:
> Per-section answers like the template above. A reader who never clicks the PR should still come away knowing what changed and why.

### 11. Final wrap-up

After iterating every repo, end with a `## Summary` listing each watched repo and its outcome: PR url, skipped, or failed. If every repo was skipped, do NOT send a notification at all — just log the per-repo skip lines.

## Sandbox Note

All GitHub operations go through `gh` CLI — handles auth internally via `GITHUB_TOKEN`. No env-var-authenticated curl from bash. The `./notify` call uses the standard fan-out pattern.

## Environment Variables

- `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` — required. Cross-repo access (the token needs permission to fork/push/PR on every watched repo).

## Guidelines

- ONE feature per repo per run. Don't bundle unrelated changes inside a single PR.
- Understand before you change. Read the codebase first. Don't guess at conventions.
- Match the repo's style. If they use tabs, use tabs. If they use semicolons, use semicolons.
- Small, high-quality PRs > ambitious rewrites. A 10-line bug fix beats a 500-line refactor.
- If the repo has CI, make sure your changes won't break it.
- Never push to main/master. Always branch.
- If you can't find anything worth doing on a repo, log "no suitable feature" and skip — that's a valid outcome.
- Don't add unnecessary abstractions, comments, or documentation the repo doesn't need.
